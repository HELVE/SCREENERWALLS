Art vs Regime Game

Art vs Regime. But so much more. Privacy. Used to be a short film screenplay.

Fjordan Andersen
Those moments when lecturing on the lack of quality in Man and temporal squanderment cause a misanthropic despair that almost extinguishes prospects of hope in the foreseeable future. I seem to rapidly lose faith in the peaceful resolution that I've been restrained to in favor of strategic violence against that and those which I deem in the pale light of supposed understanding, pathogenic to progress.

Tempus fugit, sic semper tyrannis.Â
